# Agent pocket

**A user-governed permission wallet for the AI agent era.**

We believe the next internet interaction model is not just "users clicking apps," but users delegating outcomes to intelligent agents.

That future only works if delegation is controlled.

Agent pocket exists to make that control real.

## Why We Exist

AI agents are becoming capable of taking economic actions: paying, signing, subscribing, rebalancing, and coordinating services.

When machines can act, the central question is no longer capability. It is governance.

Without a user-governed permission layer, AI-powered execution creates unacceptable risk:
- too much blind trust
- unclear accountability
- irreversible mistakes at machine speed

Agent pocket is built around one principle:

**AI can execute, but users must remain the authority.**

## Our Product Approach (Non-Technical)

We focus on a practical, human-centered control model:

1. **User ownership first**  
   The user remains the final decision-maker for value and identity.

2. **Permission before automation**  
   Delegation is explicit, bounded, and revocable.

3. **Clarity before confirmation**  
   Requests must be understandable enough for real consent.

4. **Policies over one-time clicks**  
   Users can define operating boundaries, not just react to popups.

This is not a "fully manual" world, and not a "fully autonomous" world.  
It is a governed automation model.

## What Agent pocket Does

Agent pocket acts as a control plane between users and agent-driven actions.

Its role is to:
- translate machine requests into human decisions
- enforce user-defined boundaries
- preserve user sovereignty while enabling automation
- make high-frequency execution possible without surrendering trust

In short, it turns wallets from storage interfaces into decision infrastructure.

## Risk Perspective

This category is powerful, but not risk-free.

The most important risks are:

- **Consent fatigue**: users approve without understanding.
- **Delegation drift**: convenience expands beyond safe boundaries.
- **Source trust risk**: malicious request originators can still exploit weak review behavior.
- **Responsibility ambiguity**: unclear attribution of who requested, who approved, and what executed.

Our position is clear:

**A permission wallet must be opinionated about safety, not neutral about risk.**

## Why User-Supervised Permission Wallets Are Necessary for AI Agents

As AI shifts from advisor to operator, user supervision is no longer optional.

A user-supervised permission wallet is necessary because it provides:

- **Separation of roles**: intelligence can recommend, authority stays with the user.
- **Scalable consent**: users can delegate recurring behavior without giving unlimited power.
- **Controlled failure boundaries**: mistakes are constrained by policy.
- **Real agency**: the user can inspect, approve, deny, and revoke.
- **Adoption legitimacy**: trust grows only when autonomy is auditable and reversible.

If AI agents are the new operators, permission wallets are the governance foundation.

## What This Can Change

We see Agent pocket enabling a major shift in digital behavior:

### From Interface Work to Outcome Delegation
People define intent. Agents execute within policy.

### From Reactive Security to Built-In Governance
Safety moves from afterthought to operating model.

### From Isolated Wallet Actions to Continuous Personal Operations
Finance and authorization become programmable under user control.

## What New Applications This Unlocks

- personal and business payment agents with bounded authority
- policy-governed treasury and asset operations
- revocable agent marketplaces with scoped permissions
- user-controlled machine-to-machine commerce
- team wallets with delegated roles and clear accountability
- compliance-aware autonomous workflows

---

## Our Direction

Agent pocket is building toward a future where AI is useful without being unchecked.

We are not optimizing for maximum automation.
We are optimizing for **trusted automation under user governance**.

That is how AI can scale in finance without breaking user trust.
